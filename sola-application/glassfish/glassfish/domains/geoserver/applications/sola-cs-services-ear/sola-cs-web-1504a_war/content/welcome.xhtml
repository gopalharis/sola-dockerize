            <h1>Welcome to SOLA Community Server</h1>
            <p>
                Using SOLA Community server you can <h:link outcome="user/registration">register</h:link> as a 
                Community Member and view claims made by community members. 
                User registration can be done online and once you complete registration Community Technologist
                will review it and approve. Upon approval a confirmation code will be sent to your e-mail address. 
                You will then need to activate your registration request, by following the received link. 
                Another way is to contact your Community Technologist and they will enroll 
                you as a registered user. 
                <p></p>
                All Community Member registrations are subject to review and approval by the Community Server Technologist 
                and the Community Moderation Committee.
                <p></p>
                If you are already registered, use <h:link outcome="login">Login page</h:link> to login into the system.
